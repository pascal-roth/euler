# Run Docker Container on ETHZ Euler Cluster

## Overview
This work contains a collection of scripts that enable users to run jobs on euler using a Docker image that is executed as a Singularity file. The scripts handle the building of the Docker image, allowing the user to define the exact packages and dependencies needed for the job within the Dockerfile. The scripts also handle the conversion of the Docker image to a Singularity file.
